OBJECTIVE
=============

The objective of the game is to trap the opponent's king so that its escape is
not possible (checkmate). If a player's king is threatened with capture, it is
said to be in check, and the player must remove the threat of capture on the 
next move. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate.
